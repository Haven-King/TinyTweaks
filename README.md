# TinyTweaks
A collection of small tweaks for Minecraft.

## Plant Tweaks
* Easy Harvest Crops - Right clicking fully grown clops harvests and replants them
* Easy Harvest Sugarcane - Right clicking sugarcane harvests all sugarcane higher than the one you clicked. Preserves the bottom-most block
* Auto Planting - Plants that fall on dirt or grass will automatically plant. Applies to saplings, wheat seeds, pumpkin seeds, melon seeds, beetroot seeds, carrots, and potatoes
* Grass Spreading - Grass and long grass spread naturally over time
* Plant Hitboxes - Removes hitboxes from long grass. Hitboxes are shown when using shears. Seeds can be gathered by using a hoe on the ground below them
* Passable Leaves - Removes collision from leaves
* Better Lily Pads - Allows boats to pass through lily pads without breaking them. Also allows entities to rise through the bottom of a lily pad
* Farmer Villager Automation - Farmer villagers will deposit excess items into a nearby chest

## Animal Tweaks
* Animals Eat off the Ground - Chickens, cows, horses, pigs, sheep, and wolves will eat off the ground
* Wild Wolves Breed - Wild wolves are able to be bred. Allows for some neat natural systems!

## Miscellaneous Tweaks
* Bubble Columns Flow - When set to On, bubble columns behave as they do in vanilla. When set to Off, bubble columns don't spread water to their surrounding blocks
* Burned Logs Drop Charcoal - When a log on fire burns, it drops a charcoal (Also makes charcoal fireproof)
* Double Doors - Doors and trapdoors open adjacent doors and trapdoors of the same type. Works when opened by hand or with redstone
* Editable Signs - No config for this one, just don't use it if you don't want it!
* Entity Ignition - Right click mobs with flint and steel to light them on fire
* Sturdy Lanterns - Gives lanterns a blast resistance of 6 (allows them to survive Ghast fireballs)
* Infinite Cauldrons - Right clicking a Cauldron with a Heart of the Sea creates an infinite water source
* Easy XP - All vanilla XP sources give their XP directly to the player that earns them (other than the Ender Dragon)
* Tinted Tipped Arrows - The heads of tipped arrows render the color of their status effect
